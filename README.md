# TDD Development

> In this project I have applied TDD to build functions.

## Built With

- Javascript (vanilla)
- JEST
- NPM
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
- A browser to open the main file
- Node.js
- NPM
### Setup
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. If you do not have git installed in your system, skip this step and go to step 3; otherwise, go to the directory where you want to copy the project files and clone it by copying this text into your command prompt/terminal: `git@github.com:StarSheriff2/TDD-test-practice.git`.
<br>Now go to the ***"Install Dependencies"*** section
3. Download the program files by clicking on the green button that says ‚Äú**Code**‚Äù on the upper right side of the project frame.
4. You will see a dropdown menu. Click on ‚Äú**Download ZIP**.‚Äù
5. Go to the directory where you downloaded the **ZIP file** and open it. Extract its contents to any directory you want in your system.

### Install Dependencies
1. Go to the root directory of the project
2. In your command line, while in the root dir, type `npm install`. It will install all necessary dependencies in your project files
3. Now type `npm run watch`. It should output all the test results in your command line interface.<br><br>
**Note:<br>_This command will not stop on its own. To exit, hit "ctrl + c"_**
